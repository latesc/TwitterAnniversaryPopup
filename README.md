# Twitter Anniversary Popup

**Twitter Anniversary Popup** is a simple React application that generates a Twitter anniversary popup link. Users can fill out a form with the necessary details, and upon submission, a link is generated. The link can be copied to the clipboard for sharing or further use. Skip to [Usage](#usage) to see how to use the app.

### Note

-   The link only works when it's opened within the app, such as from DMs or from tweets.
